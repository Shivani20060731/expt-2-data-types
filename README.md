EXPERIMENT-2:-
Aim: To study and implement C++ Program Structure (Data Types).

Theory:

This program demonstrates the use of several basic data types in C++. Data types help us store different kinds of values in a program. The int type is used to store whole numbers without decimals, such as 5 or 100, and usually requires 4 bytes of memory. The float type stores decimal numbers with less precision, like 3.14, and also takes about 4 bytes. For more precise decimal numbers, C++ provides the double type, which uses 8 bytes of memory. The char type is used to store a single character, such as 'A' or 'z', and it occupies 1 byte. The string type stores a sequence of characters, like words or sentences, and its size depends on the number of characters entered. Lastly, the bool type stores values that are either true or false and usually takes 1 byte.

In the program, the user is asked to input a value for each of these data types one by one. After entering each value, the program displays the value back to the user along with the amount of memory it occupies, which is found using the sizeof() operator. For example, after entering an integer, the program will print both the integer value and its memory size. The same is done for the float, character, double, string, and boolean values. Itâ€™s important to note that when displaying the size of a string, the sizeof() operator returns the size of the string object itself, not the length of the text typed by the user.

This experiment helps in understanding the basic data types available in C++ and how much memory each type requires. Knowing this helps programmers choose the right data type for their variables depending on the kind of data they want to store.

Conclusion:
Hence, we were able to understand various data types in C++ and the memory sizes they occupy, which is useful in writing efficient programs.
